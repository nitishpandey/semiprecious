<p  >Emeralds belong to beryl mineral family with chromium which is responsible for its green coloration. The name emerald comes from the Greek 'smaragdos' via the Old French 'esmeralde', and really just means 'green gemstone'. Emeralds have tiny inclusions resembling green foliage, which the French called &quot;jardin&quot;. Some high quality emeralds may be as or even more expensive than diamonds.</p>
 
 <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Physical and Chemical Properties</span>
<p  >The Emerald is a member of the beryl family of minerals. Its chemical formula is Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub> (SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>. The green crystals grow slowly within metamorphic rocks and are restricted in size by the rock, making large Emeralds rare and costly. Emerald hardness ranges from 7.5 to 8 on the Mohs scale. Even though emeralds are relatively hard stones but due to little inclusions an cracks in emeralds can affect their durability. Emeralds occur in hues ranging from yellowish green to bluish green. The primary hue must, of course, be green.</p>
