Sorry for a whole two month gap in sending an email, we have been busy adding new items.  <p>

Announcements:<p>

1. There are now over 700 items, as always <b>New items show up first in any category or stone type</b>. We added very very pretty, oh gorgeous cross pendants.  Even if you are not a Christian, worth a look.  There is a link from center of home page to cross pendants section.<p>

2. Coupon Code: For you, the subsriber, 30% off an all items except on sale items by using coupon code NANAJI. This will last 2 weeks only.

As always, you can access all items on sale using the following link:<p>

3. Charity: If you buy $200 or more worth of items, we will donate 10% to your favorite charity.  Just email us after you place an order.<p>

4. Below any necklace's zoomed image is a link that takes you to a page showing how different lengths of necklaces lie on the neck, this is on a QVC site.<p>

5. Link added from zoom page to email your friends or family a link to the item you are viewing.<p>

We now take phone orders as well.  We also take payment by Credit Cards through Authorize.net, 2checkout, and Paypal. As you know, Paypal allows non-members to pay using credit card or even members who do not sign in to Paypal to pay by credit card.<p>

If you need a CD of images to view faster and then order by phone, email me address at anup@semiprecious.com<p>
