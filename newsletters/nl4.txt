
read this newsletter carefully, here and by opening up nl4.txt on the site.
then you can start writing out your nl4.txt (note txt) the 3rd newsletter. similarly you will 
have to edit the nlheader.txt and nlfooter.txt. nlheader is required if you want to say something before you say hello brian,
.If you want to start off directly with hello brian then nlheader is also not required. just keep it blank. similarly you can keep 
nlfooter.txt (note txt extn) blank.
Start this (nl4.txt) with a "return' or newline. and end with a return
1. THis is item 1
2.and this item 2 with a link <a href="http://www.semiprecious.com/topselling.cfm">best selling</a> jewelry.
	- Thanks (here i gave a return on the keyboard)
