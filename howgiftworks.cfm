nitish: the gift thing works like this. you will get a call telling you the gift id or you will get email from 2checkout with invoice numhber having a G at the end. Use this id /invoice number in giftid.cfm. a link to this page is there on the admin page. here you can first choose to view the certiificate by filling in the giftid or the cartid provided by 2CO. then you can in next step 'activate' it. the user can then use information given to him , the id and an email , validate his gift and then shop. after shopping he is to make balacnce payment if any. he will not be charged basic shipping if any. his cart will contain coupon code has the giftid and the shipping column will have the word 'gift' in it. He will now mail you the cartid (items) and the giftid. on recieving these and waiting ofr pay

nitish: ment you will ship his items and then again use giftid.cfm to first check that the giftid provided and used by him is of the right value and is 'active'. After shipping you use giftid.cfm to delete the giftid from the 'gifts' table again by using giftid.cfm.
