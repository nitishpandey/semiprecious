<span class="hptitle"><a name="AGATEMARK">AGATE</a></span><br>
<span class="hptext">Agate was discovered with the Stone Age man in France 20,000-16,000 BC. The 
Egyptians used it prior to 3000 BC. Agate was highly valued by ancient 
civilizations. Said by the ancients to render the wearer invisible. <br>
The agate-working industry grew up centuries ago in the Idar-Oberstein district 
of Germany, where agates were abundant.
Cameos are cut from stones, such as onyx or agate, where different colors occur 
in layers. The background material is cut away, leaving the cameo design in 
relief. Agate is one of the gemstones, that used in commesso, also called 
florentine mosaic. Commesso is a technique of fashioning pictures with thin, 
cut-to-shape pieces of brightly colored, semiprecious stones, developed in 
Florence in the late 16th century. The stones most commonly used are agates, 
quartzes, chalcedonies, jaspers, granites, porphyries, petrified woods, and 
lapis lazuli. Commesso pictures, used mainly for tabletops and small wall 
panels, range from emblematic and floral subjects to landscapes. Agate derives 
its name from the Greek &quot;Agate&#1077;&#1089;&quot; – meaning happy.&nbsp; According to another theory 
the word Agate comes from the Greek name of a stone found in the Achates River 
in Sicily, now known as the Drillo River, which still remains a major source of 
this stone.

<span class="hptitle"><a name="AMETHYSTMARK">AMETHYST</a></span><br>
<span class="hptext">The story of the origin of amethyst comes from Greek legends: <i>The god of 
wine, Bacchus, was insulted one day by a mere mortal. He swore the next mortal 
that crossed his path, would be attacked by his fierce tigers. Along came a 
beautiful maiden named Amethyst. Goddess Diana turned Amethyst in a beautiful 
statue of quartz to save her from the tigers claws. Remorseful Bacchus wept 
tears of wine over the stone maiden, creating a lively purple stone.</i> <br>
Purple color has long been considered a royal color so it is not surprising that 
amethyst has been so popular through the history. Fine amethysts are featured in 
the British Crown Jewels and were also a favorite of Catherine the Great and 
Egyptian royalty. There are evidences that around 3,000 B. C. in Egypt and in 
anterior Asia were made jewels of Amethyst.
The Amethyst is perhaps as popular today as it was in ancient time. Amethyst 
derives its name from Middle English amatist, from Old French, from Latin 
amethystus, from Greek amethustos, not drunk or intoxicating.

<span class="hptext">In the Middle Ages, bloodstone (sometimes also called blood jasper in the trade) 
was attributed special powers as the spots were thought to be the blood of Jesus 
Christ. It was used in sculptures representing flagellation and martyrdom.&nbsp; 
It is often used as seals for men's rings and for ornamental objects. Bloodstone 
is a stone with red spots which resemble drops of blood, so it is received its 
name due to this similarity. Heliotrope derives its name from Greek words 
meaning sun and turning.

<span class="hptext">Ancient Egyptian tombs are full of examples of Carnelian jewels, 
because of their belief in the stone’s power in the afterlife. According to 
their system, amulets of Carnelian could prove helpful in ensuring the Ka’s (the 
soul’s) passage into the next world. In more modern times, Goethe attributed the 
powers of protection against evil, of continuation of hope and comfort, and of 
good luck. The blood-red varieties were greatly valued by the ancients, who 
produced beautiful engravings in carnelian and also used them for seals. 
Buddhists in China and India created amulets inlaid with Carnelian and other 
semi-precious stones, ascribing to them powers of protection and utilizing them 
for many rituals.

<span class="hptext">Garnets were so called by the ancient Greeks since color reminded them of the 
pomegranate seed or granatum. One of the world's most ancient gems, garnet has 
been treasured for thousands of years. <br>
Use of garnets as gems is traced to the Nile Delta in 3100 B.C. Egyptian 
artisans created beautiful garnet beads, bracelets and other jewelry. Garnets 
since ancient times used widely as an abrasive. Garnets are said to have been 
used by Asiatic tribes in place of bullets. During the latter part of the 19th 
century, garnet bracelets and brooches were particularly popular. Most familiar 
during the peak of popularity were varieties of pyrope. The hardness of garnets 
and their sharp fracture make them suitable as abrasives for wood, leather, 
glass, metals, and plastics. Garnet varieties have become known by misleading 
names, frequently consisting of a locality with the name of another mineral 
variety, such as Uralian emerald or Cape ruby.

<span class="hptext">The name jasper is derived from the Greek word iaspis. In ancient writings the 
term jasper was chiefly applied to translucent and brightly colored stones, 
particularly chalcedony, but also was applied to the opaque jasper. <br>
Jasper was known as the great &quot;rain-bringer&quot; in the fourth century. For 
thousands of years, black jasper was used to test gold-silver alloys for their 
gold content. Rubbing the alloys on the stone, called a touchstone, produces a 
streak the color of which determines the gold content within one part in one 
hundred. Jasper is one of the gemstones, that used in commesso, also called 
florentine mosaic. Commesso is a technique of fashioning pictures with thin,

Mining Malachite began as early as 4000 BC by ancient Egyptians. In the Middle 
ages, malachite was worn to protect from black magic and sorcery. In Ancient 
Greece amulets for children were made of malachite. In the New Stone Age came 
the discovery of the possibility of extracting certain metals from the ores in 
which they generally occur. Probably the first such material to be used was 
malachite, then already in use as a cosmetic and easily reduced to copper in a 
strong fire. It is impossible to be precise about the time and place of this 
discovery, but its consequences were tremendous. Namely it led to the search for 
other metallic ores, to the development of metallurgy.

<span class="hptext">The discovery that pearls could be cultivated in freshwater mussels is said to 
have been made in 13th-century China, and the Chinese have been adept for 
hundreds of years at cultivating pearls by opening the mussel's shell and 
inserting into it small pellets of mud or tiny bosses of wood, bone, or metal 
and returning the mussel to its bed for about three years to await the 
maturation of a pearl formation. Cultured pearls of China have been almost 
exclusively blister pearls. <br>
The production of whole cultured pearls was perfected by the Japanese. The 
research that led to the establishment of the industry was started in the 1890s 
by Mikimoto Kokichi, who, after long experimentation, concluded that a very 
small mother-of-pearl bead introduced into the mollusk's tissue was the most 
successful stimulant to pearl production. Cultured pearls closely approximate 
natural pearls.

jewelry work. In Pre-Columbian America, explorations of Mixtec graves have

During medieval days tourmaline was thought to heal physical and mental 
disorders as well as prevent death. Used as a gem for over 2,000 years. In 
addition to its use as a gem, tourmaline is employed in pressure devices because 
of its piezoelectric properties. It has been used in depth-sounding apparatus 
and other devices that detect and measure variations in pressure. <br>
The colored crystals of tourmaline are very strongly dichroic – i.e., they are 
of different color when viewed in the direction of different axes. Plates cut 
parallel to the vertical axis of a tourmaline crystal allow only the 
extraordinary ray through; if two such plates are placed in crossed position, 
the light is entirely blocked. A pair of these plates form a very simple 
polarizing apparatus known as tourmaline tongs.

<span class="hptext">The name turquoise undoubtedly comes from turc (Turkish in French) as it was 
transported to Europe through Turkey. W its blue hue, it is among the oldest 
known gemstones. Turquoise was obtained from the Sinai Peninsula before the 4th 
millennium BC in one of the world's first important hard-rock mining operations. 
Turquoise was in use even before 4000 BC! The Aztec of Mexico commonly used 
turquoise for their fine mosaic art and introduced the stone to the surrounding 
areas, where it became known as chalchihuitl.<br>
It was an important ornamental mineral for jewelry and bracelets wore by the 
ancient Egyptians. It graced the necks of Egyptian Pharaohs and adorned the 
ceremonial dress of early native Americans. Turquoise has been attributed with 
healing powers as well as promoting the wearer's status and wealth. A very 
special stone indeed, Turquoise is a sacred stone to many American Indian tribes 
and has been used in various jewelry items.
