  HISTORY</strong><br>
  <br>
  Amber became widely used during the Roman era. An interesting belief during 
  that time was that the rays of the setting sun became congealed in the sea and 
  then were cast upon the shore in the form of amber. In 240 B.C. an astrologer 
  discovered that amber had many of the same characteristics and properties of 
  gemstones, even though amber is not mined as most semiprecious stones. Rather, 
  amber is actually fossilized resin from trees. Even though it is not mined, 
  amber is still considered a beautiful and durable gem. In ancient times amber 
  was first used for medicinal purposes then later became a popular feature of 
  jewelry. Early on, amber was ground into a powder and mixed with wine. The belief 
  was that the properties of amber when consumed provided relief from coup,asthma,fever, 
  and tonsillitis. After being consumed, a chunk of amber was worn around the 
  neck. After being ground into a powder, amber was mixed with honey and rose 
  oil and packed into an infected ear, a primitive foreshadowing of amber earrings. 
  These ancient medical remedies were the link to amber becoming a popular jewelry 
  item. One can easily see how amber made the transition from medical remedy to 
  jewelry. Because of it's radiant color and durability, amber has become a widespread 
  choice for rings, earrings, bracelets, and necklace pendants.<br>

  <strong>CHEMICAL</strong><br>
  <br>
  A natural ionizer, amber possesses electrostatic properties and has the ability 
  to produce negative ions. It is not a mineral because amber has an organic origin 
  and amorphous structure; amber is actually petrified tree sap. Minerals have 
  an orderly internal arrangement of atoms. The chemical composition of amber 
  can vary greatly depending on the botanical source. All amber types have terpenes 
  or compounds that are linked as the resin matures. This fossil resin that forms 
  the basis of amber contains 3-8% succenic acid. A typical of amber is 67-87% 
  carbon, 9-11% hydrogen, 15% oxygen, and 0-0.46% sulfur.<br>

  <strong>GEOGRAPHY</strong><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Baltic Sea region has been the original source for amber since prehistoric 
  times. This region is the source of the amber that was discovered in Egyptian 
  tombs that date back to 3200 B.C. Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia 
  have some 100 Neolithic burial sites in which amber has been found. Vikings 
  referred to amber as &quot;gold from the north&quot;, and Scandinavia continues 
  to be a major exporter of amber today. The Dominican Republic is the most plentiful 
  source of amber outside of the Baltic area. England has also been known to yield 
  prehistoric amber artifacts. Other regions where amber can be found include 
  Tanzania, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Sicily, and the United States. 
  Indeed, the geographic occurrence of amber is consistently widespread.<br>
