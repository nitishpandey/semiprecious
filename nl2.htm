Newsletter 1 from <a href='http://www.semiprecious.com'>Semiprecious.com</a><p>

Welcome to <b>SEMIPRECIOUS.COM</b> first announcement email in a long long time.  I was hoping for the illegal spamming to reduce before working on a tool to manage and send monthly announcements to our subscribers. The illegal spamming has not reduced, but I can not wait forever.  The govt. is too busy in Iraq I guess.  OK, this one is going to be short. <p>
