    <span class="hptext">Agate is the stone for self-expression, creativity, health and good fortune. It 
    makes it much easier to open up oneself. Soothes emotions and pain. Sensitizes 
    and attunes senses. Helps to develop powers of eloquence, self-confidence and 
    public-speaking. It is believed to be of special benefit to athletes and to 
    those taking any kind of examination or test &ndash; mental or physical. It eases a 
    sore throat and takes away the hoarseness. This stone also works directly with 
    the nervous system to alleviate physical tension and is said to be a treatment 
    of arthritis, skeletal conditions, and as an aid to digestion. General healing, 
    reduces fever, hardens tender gums, gives courage and banishes fear.<br>

  <cfif infotopic eq "all" or infotopic eq "physical">
    <span class="hptext">Agate comes in most colors. Agates 
    range from transparent to opaque in a variety of beautiful colors. Agate 
    presents various tints in the same specimen. The stones can be artificially 
    stained to produce combinations of color more vivid than those found in the 
    natural state. It is a semipellucid crystallized quartz, consisting of banded or 
    with branching inclusions of chalcedony. Physical properties of agate are in 
    general like those of quartz. Agate has irregular, sometimes circular bands of color 
    and often replaces fossil wood. Many fossils are agatized material where the 
    original organic substance has been replaced by agate while retaining the 
    original structure. Agates are identical in chemical structure to jasper, flint, 
    chert, bloodstone, and tiger-eye, and are often found in association with opal. 
    The colorful, banded rocks are used as a semiprecious gemstone and for making 
    mortars and pestles. One will often see these in beads, agate pendants and 
    necklaces. </span>

    <span class="hptext">Agate was discovered with the Stone Age man in France 20,000-16,000 BC. The 
    Egyptians used it prior to 3000 BC. Agate was highly valued by ancient 
    civilizations. Said by the ancients to render the wearer invisible. <br>
    The agate-working industry grew up centuries ago in the Idar-Oberstein district 
    of Germany, where agates were abundant.
    Cameos are cut from stones, such as onyx or agate, where different colors occur 
    in layers. The background material is cut away, leaving the cameo design in 
    relief. Agate is one of the gemstones, that used in commesso, also called 
    florentine mosaic. Commesso is a technique of fashioning pictures with thin, 
    cut-to-shape pieces of brightly colored, semiprecious stones, developed in 
    Florence in the late 16th century. The stones most commonly used are agates, 
    quartzes, chalcedonies, jaspers, granites, porphyries, petrified woods, and 
    lapis lazuli. Commesso pictures, used mainly for tabletops and small wall 
    panels, range from emblematic and floral subjects to landscapes. Agate derives 
    its name from the Greek &quot;Agate&#1077;&#1089;&quot; &ndash; meaning happy.&nbsp; According to another theory 
    the word Agate comes from the Greek name of a stone found in the Achates River 
    in Sicily, now known as the Drillo River, which still remains a major source of 
    this stone. </span>

  <cfif infotopic eq "all" or infotopic eq "geographic">
    <span class="hptext">Important sources of agate are Russia (Ural mountains), Brazil, Egypt, Germany,

psychic abilities, inner peace, healing and positive transformation. This stone 
brings an understanding of death and rebirth and aids in past-life recall. Keep 
it under your pillow to cure insomnia and develop intuitive powers. Also 
relieves stress and brings calmness in times of grief. Protects against blood

<span class="hptext">Found in abundance, 
in its purest form, amethyst is colorless. The finest quality amethyst is medium 
to medium dark in tone, vivid in intensity, and purple, reddish purple to bluish 
purple in hue. Heating removes the color from amethyst or changes it to the 
yellow of citrine. Most commercial citrine is made in this manner. Amethyst is 
the most valuable transparent, coarse-grained variety of the silica mineral 
quartz that is valued as a semiprecious gem for its violet color. It contains 
more iron oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> than any other variety of 
quartz, and experts believe that its color arises from its iron content. Other 
theories attribute the color to contained manganese or hydrocarbons. All forms 
of quartz (including amethyst) are piezoelectric, making for important 
applications in electronics. Tourmaline is the only other gemstone that 
posesses this property. </span>

<span class="hptext">The story of the origin of amethyst comes from Greek legends: <i>The god of 
wine, Bacchus, was insulted one day by a mere mortal. He swore the next mortal 
that crossed his path, would be attacked by his fierce tigers. Along came a 
beautiful maiden named Amethyst. Goddess Diana turned Amethyst in a beautiful 
statue of quartz to save her from the tigers claws. Remorseful Bacchus wept 
tears of wine over the stone maiden, creating a lively purple stone.</i> <br>
Purple color has long been considered a royal color so it is not surprising that 
amethyst has been so popular through the history. Fine amethysts are featured in 
the British Crown Jewels and were also a favorite of Catherine the Great and 
Egyptian royalty. There are evidences that around 3,000 B. C. in Egypt and in 
anterior Asia were made jewels of Amethyst.
The Amethyst is perhaps as popular today as it was in ancient time. Amethyst 
derives its name from Middle English amatist, from Old French, from Latin 
amethystus, from Greek amethustos, not drunk or intoxicating. </span> <img border="0" src="dcd.bmp" width="533" height="7">

reputation for having better, more saturated, color in small sizes. Very dark 
amethyst, mostly in small sizes, is also mined in Australia.<br>

containing some iron, calcium, and magnesium. It belongs to the group of 
minerals called pyroxenes. Jadeite crystallizes in the monoclinic system but 
rarely occurs in distinct crystals and is usually found 
in fibrous, compact, massive aggregates. The luster on fresh fracture is dull 
and wax-like, but polished jadeite has a vitreous luster. 
Nephrite, a member of the amphibole group of minerals, is a silicate of calcium 
and magnesium, with a small amount of iron replacing part of the magnesium. It 
is a tough, compact variety of the mineral tremolite. Polished nephrite has an 
oily luster. </span>

Jasper was known as the great &quot;rain-bringer&quot; in the fourth century. For

gold content. Rubbing the alloys on the stone, called a touchstone, produces a 
streak the color of which determines the gold content within one part in one 
hundred. Jasper is one of the gemstones, that used in commesso, also called 
florentine mosaic. Commesso is a technique of fashioning pictures with thin, 
cut-to-shape pieces of brightly colored, semiprecious stones, developed in 
Florence in the late 16th century. The stones most commonly used are agates, 
quartzes, chalcedonies, jaspers, granites, porphyries, petrified woods, and

another theory the word malachite comes from Greek malhe, which means grass. 
Mining Malachite began as early as 4000 BC by ancient Egyptians. In the Middle 
ages, malachite was worn to protect from black magic and sorcery. In Ancient 
Greece amulets for children were made of malachite. In the New Stone Age came 
the discovery of the possibility of extracting certain metals from the ores in 
which they generally occur. Probably the first such material to be used was 
malachite, then already in use as a cosmetic and easily reduced to copper in a 
strong fire. It is impossible to be precise about the time and place of this 
discovery, but its consequences were tremendous. Namely it led to the search for 
other metallic ores, to the development of metallurgy. </span>

<span class="hptext">The color of pearls varies with the mollusk and its environment. It 
ranges from black to white, with the rose of Indian pearls esteemed most. Other 
colors are cream, gray, blue, yellow, lavender, green, and mauve. All occur in 
delicate shades. <i>Cultured pearls</i> are being produced in virtually every 
color of the rainbow.The chief component of the nacre that constitutes the pearl 
is aragonite CaCO. Pearls are formed by a mollusk consisting of the same 
material (called nacre, or mother-of-pearl) as the mollusk's shell. It is a 
highly valued gemstone. The shell-secreting cells of the mollusk are located in 
the mantleof its body. When a foreign particle penetrates the mantle, the cells 
attach to the particle and build up more or less concentric layers of pearl 
around it. Irregularly shaped pearls called baroque pearls are those that have 
grown in muscular tissue. Pearls that grow adjacent to the shell are often flat 
on one side and are called blister pearls. Pearls are characterized by their 
translucence and lustre and by a delicate play of surface color called orient. 
The more perfect its shape (spherical or droplike) and the deeper its lustre, 
the greater its value. Only those pearls produced by mollusks whose shells are 
lined with mother-of-pearl (e.g., certain species of both saltwater oysters and 
freshwater clams) are really fine pearls. Pearls from other mollusks are reddish 
or whitish, porcellaneous, or lacking in pearly lustre. The surface of a pearl 
is rough to the touch. Pearls come in a wide range of sizes. Those weighing less 
than 1/4 grain (1 pearl grain = 50 milligrams = 1/4 carat) are called seed 
pearls. The largest naturally occurring pearls are the baroque pearls; one such 
pearl is known to have weighed 1,860 grains. <br>
<i>Cultured pearl</i> is natural but cultivated pearl produced by a mollusk 
after the intentional introduction of a foreign object inside the creature's 
shell. </span>

<span class="hptext">The discovery that pearls could be cultivated in freshwater mussels is said to 
have been made in 13th-century China, and the Chinese have been adept for 
hundreds of years at cultivating pearls by opening the mussel's shell and 
inserting into it small pellets of mud or tiny bosses of wood, bone, or metal 
and returning the mussel to its bed for about three years to await the 
maturation of a pearl formation. Cultured pearls of China have been almost 
exclusively blister pearls. <br>
The production of whole cultured pearls was perfected by the Japanese. The 
research that led to the establishment of the industry was started in the 1890s 
by Mikimoto Kokichi, who, after long experimentation, concluded that a very 
small mother-of-pearl bead introduced into the mollusk's tissue was the most 
successful stimulant to pearl production. Cultured pearls closely approximate 
natural pearls. </span>

waters off Celebes, Indonesia, and the islands of the South Pacific. In the 
Americas, the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the waters of the 
Pacific coast of Mexico have yielded dark-hued pearls with a metallic sheen as 
well as white pearls of good quality. <br>
Freshwater mussels in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere have 
produced pearls of great value, as for example those from the Mississippi River. 
Pearling is a carefully fostered industry in central Europe, and the forest 
streams of Bavaria, in particular, are the source of choice pearls. Freshwater 
pearling in China has been known from before 1000 BC. <br>
Cultured pearls: Northern Australia established its first cultured pearl farms 
in the 1960s, that by the mid-1970s were an established industry, producing 
pearl shell as well as pearls. Japan and Australia are the largest producers of 
cultured pearls, though Fiji also produces some.<br>

not known. The name quartz possibly comes from a Saxon word meaning cross vein 
ore, while some it is instead derived from the Slavic word kwardy (hard). The Greeks had originally named Quartz, Krystallos, the word for ice, but 
this soon came to mean any crystal The gem varieties of quartz have been used as 
gemstones and other ornamental objects for thousands of years. Polished rock 
crystal spheres or crystal balls were used as a means of divination or scrying 
in medieval times. In China&rsquo;s Ming Dynasty, Quartz often showed up as stone in 
jewelry work. In Pre-Columbian America, explorations of Mixtec graves have 
uncovered Quartz use for ear jewelry For thousands of years before this, quartz 
crystals and objects made from them were used for divination, disease diagnosis 
and for awareness of current events in distant places in many ancient cultures. </span>

<span class="hptext">Quartz is one of the most abundant compounds found in the Earth&rsquo;s surface and in 
most sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, and therefore, it and its many 
varieties come from thousands of locations around the globe. Quartz was even 
found on Moon during lunar explorations! Large deposits of good quality clear 
quartz have been found in Brazil, France (Dauphine), USA (Arkansas). Primary 
deposits in the USA are in
Hot Springs of Garland County, Mount Ida in Montgomery County &amp;
California-Calaveras County&rsquo;s Mokelumne Hill. Sutters Mill, site 
of the California Gold Rush of 1848 has large deposits of quartz that had gold 
veins running through them and San Diego County is famous for very unique 
samples. New York,
Herkimer County has deposits of doubly terminated quartz called Herkimer 
Diamonds. Elsewhere, quartz also occurs 
at Australia, British Columbia, Germany, India, Japan, Madagascar, Malagasy 
Republic, Man, Mexico, Namibia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and St. Gotthard, 
Switzerland.<br>

For centuries it was known by the name schrol. Colored crystals were imported 
from Sri Lanka at the beginning of the 18th century. <br>
During medieval days tourmaline was thought to heal physical and mental 
disorders as well as prevent death. Used as a gem for over 2,000 years. In 
addition to its use as a gem, tourmaline is employed in pressure devices because 
of its piezoelectric properties. It has been used in depth-sounding apparatus 
and other devices that detect and measure variations in pressure. <br>
The colored crystals of tourmaline are very strongly dichroic &ndash; i.e., they are 
of different color when viewed in the direction of different axes. Plates cut 
parallel to the vertical axis of a tourmaline crystal allow only the 
extraordinary ray through; if two such plates are placed in crossed position, 
the light is entirely blocked. A pair of these plates form a very simple 
polarizing apparatus known as tourmaline tongs. </span>
