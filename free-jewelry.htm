<p><strong><em>How to Get Free Jewelry in a dog eat dog world, is this a scam? 
  Read on:</em></strong></p>
<p>Over 2000 jewelry items available for free if you have the skills to write 
  about the very items you purchase from us. AND, you can earn free jewelry if 
  you take a digital picture of you wearing the jewelry. How does that sound? 
  So, go ahead, buy some jewelry, send us a nice write up about what you think 
  about the craftsmanship etc, and a picture of you wearing it and earn matching 
  jewelry for your bracelets/pendants/necklaces/anklets/earrings. Is there anything 
  better than getting free jewelry, and that too made of semiprecious stones? 
  Real stuff, unreal deal! You practice your creativity and earn free jewelry! 
  Wow! Its not a shamy, it is real stones, with real feelings, with healing properties, 
  with character. Not cheap jewelry but meaningful, long lasting free gemstone 
  jewelry, just for taking a good pic of yourself wearing our pendants/necklaces/earrings/bracelets 
  and soon anklets. Email us if you are interested in this deal, after you make 
  a purchase. Example of a good picture - I took this of myself just after a shower 
  - <a href=http://www.semiprecious.com/anup/boohaa.jpg>ME!</a> Ha! </p>
<p>You can also earn free jewelry by linking to www.semiprecious.com or to www.handmadelaptopcase.com 
  from your site. Email us for details with your web address.</p>
<p>If there is any other way you think you can help us grow, do write to us, and 
  in exchange, we will be happy to send you some jewelry or beads!</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
