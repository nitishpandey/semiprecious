    <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Aquamarine- March Birthstone</span>
<p >The Aquamarine is a bluish-green part of beryl mineral family. Beryl is a mineral that crystallizes within large grained igneous rocks on the earth's crust. It varies in color from clear to vibrantly colored gemstones such as the Emerald. Pure beryl is a transparent mineral consisting of aluminum and beryllium, but iron adds blue green colors to the crystal and results in unique crystals of aquamarine. Beryl was used as far back as 2,000 years ago to correct vision, and it continues to be used today in the manufacture of eyeglasses. It is a very hard mineral, making the Aquamarine a durable gemstone for use in jewelry.</p>
 
    <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Geographical Information</span>
<p >Aquamarine varies in color from blue-green to a light sky blue, but gems containing green are often heat-treated to remove this less desirable color. The majority of Aquamarines, unlike other gemstones, are flawless. It is a relatively abundant gem, the largest deposits being in Brazil, but other sources of Aquamarine are in China, India, Australia, Africa, and the United States.</p>

The name Bloodstone derives from the legendary belief that the red coloration resulted from the blood of Christ spilling onto green jasper during the crucifixion.

Ideal for carving into cameos and beads, this stone symbolizes courage. </p>
