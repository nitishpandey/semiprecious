 <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">November Birthstones</span>
	    <ul  class="birthstoneinfo">
    <li>The month of November that includes the zodiac signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius has an assortment of 11 stones listed as birthstones.</li>
	<li>The birthstones marked for November are topaz, citrine, pearl and chrysophase.</li>
	<li>The zodiac signs add on seven more birthstones: beryl, aquamarine, garnet, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, and turquoise.</li>
    </ul>
 
 <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Citrine- November Birthstone</span>
<p  class="birthstoneinfo">The featured birthstone is the modern as well as the traditional stone for this month. The name Citrine comes from an old French word, &quot;citrin&quot;, meaning lemon.</p>
 
 <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Physical & Chemical Properties</span>
<p  class="birthstoneinfo">Citrine is one of the rarest varieties of quartz whose color ranges from a pale yellow to brown. It is nearly impossible to tell cut citrine from yellow topaz visibly. Citrine has a value of 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Chemically, it is a variety of quartz having the same formula, SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
 
 <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Geographical Information</span>
<p  class="birthstoneinfo">Citrine has ferric impurities, and is rarely found naturally. Most commercial citrine is in actual artificially heated amethyst or smoky quartz. Citrine crystals are found in igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine. At certain amethyst deposits (another gemstone), it was naturally changed into brown citrine by the action of high temperature. Russia, France and Madagascar are the other countries known for the occurrence of natural citrine.</p>
