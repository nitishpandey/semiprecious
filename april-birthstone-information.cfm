<p  >Diamond is an amazingly simple stone in its structure and yet it is the most brilliant natural gem. It is the most coveted gem for its bright sparkles. Diamonds have been revered throughout history &amp; used extensively to embellish items such as crowns, swords and emblems as well as jewelry.</p>
 
    <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Physical and Chemical Properties</span>
<p  >It is also hardest known natural substance in nature. Diamond has four directions of cleavage, meaning that if it receives a sharp blow in one of these directions it will cleave, or split. Thus though hard, it is not impervious. It has a value of perfect 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It has a broad color range, high refraction, high dispersion or fire, very low reactivity to chemicals, rarity, and of course, extreme hardness and durability. Pure diamond is completely colorless and transparent over a larger range of wavelengths. Diamonds may be nearly any color in the rainbow including browns, grays, and white. Shades of yellow are most common, followed by colorless. Blue, black, reddish, and greenish are more valuable.</p>
 
    <span class="birthstoneinfoheader">Geographical Information</span>
<p  >Most natural diamonds are formed at high-pressure high-temperature conditions existing at depths of 140 to 190 kilometers (87 to 120 miles) in the Earth mantle. Diamonds are brought close to the earth's surface through deep volcanic eruptions by a magma, which cools into igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites. Diamonds are believed to have been first recognized and mined in India, where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could then be found many centuries ago along the rivers. These gemstones are found primarily in Australia, the Soviet Union, Canada and Africa.</p>
